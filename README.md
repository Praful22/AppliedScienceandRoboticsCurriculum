# AppliedScienceandRoboticsCurriculum
This repository contains a preprint of my work as an instructional designer at Fisk University designing two curriculums(syllabus and course plan) for freshman and advanced undergraduate courses with the help of the Dean of the Physics Department.
# CAVEAT: Both of the curriculum/course content designed are proposals submitted to the academic research committee at Fisk University. I will publish them as final versions once the proposals get approved.
